# ENVIRONMENT HYGIENE NOTE:
# Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab and ipykernel are intentionally excluded from this
# base environment to keep runtime dependencies minimal and reproducible.
# Install them separately if needed for development:
#   mamba install -c conda-forge notebook
#   python -m pip install ipykernel
# You may also wish to create a cloned virtual environment diabetes-readmission-ml-jupyter
# specifically for notebook development, to avoid polluting the primary environment.
